# Heart Disease Prediction App

## Introduction
This Heart Disease Prediction App is a machine learning web application that uses a trained XGBoost model to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on their medical and physical characteristics.

## Features
- User-friendly web interface.
- Immediate predictions on heart disease likelihood.
- Input validation for realistic medical values.

## How It Works
Users input their medical data, including age, sex, type of chest pain, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other important health metrics. The model then processes this data and predicts whether the user is at risk of heart disease.
